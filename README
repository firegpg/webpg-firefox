WebPG provides GnuPG, GPG, PGP related Public/Private Key operations and management in Mozilla Firefox

Features as of Version 0.8.3 -

* Fully functioning Public/Private Key manager
* Inline parsing of PGP blocks and keys
* Right-click to Verify, Sign, Encrypt and Decrypt
* Rough gmail integration [EXPERIMENTAL]

In order for this to operate you *must* have some software installed depending on your operating system; namely, GnuPG and a key agent.

Keep in mind, this is beta software, it will probably have lots of bugs -- use at your own risk, and please inform me of any bugs/issues via webpg-bugs@curetheitch.com
